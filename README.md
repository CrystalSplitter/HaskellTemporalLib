# HaskellTemporalLib: Utilities for Working with Temporal Networks

This library provides types and functions to solve Temporal Problems using
Temporal Networks.

Temporal Networks are a way to represent time constraints between events, and
are useful in solving autonomous planning problems with continuous time.
